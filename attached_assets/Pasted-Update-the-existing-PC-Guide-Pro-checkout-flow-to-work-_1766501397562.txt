Update the existing PC Guide Pro checkout flow to work as a manual PC request system instead of automatic billing:

Post-checkout customer details form:

After the user clicks the Place Order / Checkout button, do not process Stripe or any online payment.

Instead, render a new form screen where the customer fills in their details, including:

Full name

Email address

Phone number (optional)

City / region

Budget (optional)

Any notes or special requests about the PC build

Pre-fill or show a summary of their selected parts/cart on this page so they know what they are submitting.

Send form data via Nodemailer:

On form submit, send all customer details and cart/build information to ctechmtv@gmail.com using Nodemailer in the Node.js backend.

Remove usage of Resend for this flow and rely on Nodemailer with SMTP configuration instead.

Structure the email clearly with:

Subject like: 'New PC Build Request – {customer name or timestamp}'

Body containing:

Customer contact details

Selected parts list (names, quantities, and prices if available)

Total estimated amount (if available)

Any notes/special requests

Success state and confirmation message:

After the email is successfully sent, update the page state and replace the form with a confirmation message such as:

'Your PC request has been sent to an expert builder. We will contact you through your email soon.'

Optionally, show a small recap of their request below the message.

Handle error states:

If the email fails to send, show a friendly error message and allow the user to retry.

Technical details:

Implement a secure POST API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/pc-request) that:

Validates required fields (name, email, etc.).

Uses Nodemailer to send the email to ctechmtv@gmail.com.

Returns success or error status to the frontend.

On the frontend (React / Vite):

Use form state and a loading flag.

After successful submission (HTTP 200), switch the UI from the form to the success message state.

Keep the existing blue/gray theme, minimal UI, and fast loading behavior.

Ensure the flow integrates with the existing cart/parts system so that all selected parts are included in the email.

Focus on replacing automated billing emails with a manual 'PC request to expert builder' flow that sends all necessary information via Nodemailer to ctechmtv@gmail.com and clearly informs the user that an expert will contact them by email soon.
